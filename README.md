Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Brightspace/node-landlord-client/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Brightspace/node-landlord-client?branch=master)

Simple helper for interacting with the Landlord APIs

## Install

```bash
npm install @d2l/landlord-client --save
```


## Usage

```js
var LandlordClient = require('@d2l/landlord-client');

var client = new LandlordClient()
	.on('error', console.error);

client
	.lookupTenantId('valence.desire2learn.com:443')
	.then(function (tenantId) {
		// do something
	})
	.catch(function (err) {
		// handle error
	});
```

### API

---

#### `new LandlordClient([Object options])` -> `LandlordClient`


##### Option: endpoint

You may optionally specify the Landlord instance to connect to.

```js
...new LandlordClient({ endpoint: 'https://landlord.brightspace.com' });
```

##### Option: cache `AbstractLandlordCache` _(LRULandlordCache)_

You may optionally specifiy an instance of a cache inheriting from
`LandlordClient.AbstractLandlordCache`.

##### Option: name `String`

**Recommended**. You may optionally specify a name to send as part of the user
agent when sending requests to Landlord. Assists in tracking issues and RCAs.

```js
...new LandlordClient({ name: 'johns-service' })
```

##### Option: blockOnRefresh `boolean` _(false)_

You may optionally adjust the behaviour of lookupTenantUrl when the cache is
stale. By default a stale cache entry will be used immediately and the attempt
to update the cached value will occur in the background. Set `blockOnRefresh`
to `true` to instead wait for the result of the refresh to complete, returning
the fresh value instead. An error will still be emitted, and the stale value
will still be used if the refresh fails.

Use this option if you believe you are slighly more sensitive to stale cache
entries (you likely are not), or if you're in an environment that is not
conducive to background / out-of-band work such as AWS Lambda.

---

#### `.lookupTenantId(String host)` -> `Promise<String>`

Given the host, will fetch then TenantId from Landlord. Returns a Promise to a
String.

---

#### `.lookupTenantUrl(String TenantId)` -> `Promise<String>`

Given the TenantId, well fetch the base url from Landlord. Returns a Promise to
a String.

---

#### `.validateConfiguration()` -> `Promise<String>`

Checks availability by pinging Landlord. Returns a Promise to a String.

___

#### `.on('error', Function<Error> callback)` -> `LandlordClient`

`LandlordClient` is an `EventEmitter` and will emit `error` events for errors
which occur outside of the normal workflow (such as background fetches). You
_should_ add an error handler , perhaps just to your logger. Failure to add an
error listener [may lead your program to
exit](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events);

---

#### `LandlordClient.errors` -> `Object`

Provided as part of the export is an object containing the well-typed errors
which may be returned from function calls.
